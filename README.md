# ESP32-smalltalk
Little Smalltalk for ESP32 with SSD1306 OLED and M5StickC support

This is a very early project. Right now builds in VisualStudio Code wiht PlatformIO plugin the and runs (on the Mac at least).

Publishing so that folks can take a look. 

However, don't start playing with the code yet... getting some more basic graphics and command line sorted then
